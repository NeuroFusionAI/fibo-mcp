       "2. **Unit of Account** - Money provides a standard measure of value, allowing us to compare the worth of different goods and services. Prices are expressed in monetary units (dollars, euros, yen, etc.).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Store of Value** - Money allows people to save purchasing power for the future. You can earn money today and spend it later.\n",

       "- **Durability** - It should last over time\n",
       "- **Portability** - Easy to carry and transfer\n",
       "- **Divisibility** - Can be broken into smaller units\n",
       "- **Uniformity** - Each unit is identical to others\n",
       "- **Acceptability** - Widely recognized and trusted\n",
       "- **Limited Supply** - Scarcity helps maintain value\n",
