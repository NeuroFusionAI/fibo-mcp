       "1. **Defined Territory** - A country has recognized geographic boundaries that separate it from other countries.\n",

       "\n",
       "4. **Sovereignty** - The authority to govern itself without interference from other countries. This is often considered the most important characteristic.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Recognition** - Other countries acknowledge its existence as an independent nation (though this can be disputed in some cases).\n",
