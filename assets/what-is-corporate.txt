 According to FIBO, a corporate (or more formally, a Corporation) is defined as:

  A formal organization that is a legal entity (artificial person) distinct from its owners, created under the jurisdiction of the laws of a state or nation

  Key Characteristics:

  FIBO identifies three distinguishing characteristics of a corporation:

  1. Separation of ownership from management and general liability
    - Its liability to creditors is limited to its resources (unlike some partnerships and sole proprietorships)
  2. Legal capacity
    - The ability to negotiate contracts and own property
  3. Transferable ownership
    - Ownership is irrespective of changes in membership or the lifetimes of its stockholders

  Governance Structure:

  - Board of Directors: A corporation is managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, which generally determines corporate policy
  - Officers: Officers manage the day-to-day affairs of the corporation

  Alternative Name:

  The term "body corporate" is listed as a synonym for corporation in FIBO.
